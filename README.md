You're running a Jormungandr node! If not, you should. At the time of writing, Jormungandr is in the testnet phase, and resources are scant and scattered all over the place.

Since it can be difficult to keep up, I decided to start pooling things I've learned and researched. It's a big effort and things are continually changing, so I'll try to keep up!

If you learn anything, please make a pull request and I'll add it in here. I'll do my best to give credit throughout!

## crony.conf keep pool time in sync

Jormungandr won't be able to make blocks if your server time is out of sync. [@lovelypool](https://github.com/lovelypool) wrote a crony script to double check server time [here](https://github.com/lovelypool/cardano_stuff/blob/master/chrony.conf). Thanks to [ilap](https://gist.github.com/ilap) for linking to it (his guides are mentioned in the next section).

## Send a tip
If you appreciate my efforts, it would make my day if you stake to my pool:
> Calico Staking Company 
> #CALI
> 1933716364a62905b0fb5fade6e45c4f6f72d65e5240ef0ae5d8ddd08dfd9471
As of yet, I haven't made a block!

Or, if you have a staking pool you like, a tip would be appreciated :)
